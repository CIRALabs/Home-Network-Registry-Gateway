##**Agenda**

2. MedKit
3. Database migration
4.Legal - Alpha contract
5. User Documentation


##**Notes**
1. App update
  a) working on the refactoring http using an updated version of the http library, in order to better catch issues when there is either 
  a misunderstanding between the app and the gateway (interop testing issue) or an error I did not forecast (many of these were found).
  b) also implementing on the app side the new /gateway/info endpoint that Daniel just implemented. This will give the team additional diagnostic information when debugging.
  c) waiting for a new stable medkit so I can resume the integration testing.
2. MedKit - new med kit released but Wan not working
3. Database migration - move from flask to Django post Alpha, will resolve some issues
4. Legal - updated document with more information
5.User Documentation - Jason to speak with Gillian
6. Add new tickets for SSH tunnel to mox for debugging, will connect with Jacques for Firewall
