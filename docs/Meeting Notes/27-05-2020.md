## **Agenda**
1. Review the survey
2. Lab IoT device requirements
3. Analysis for Alpha - what happens after analysis, what does the user see? e.g. website, location, ??
4. Filtering for Alpha - will user have to do manual filtering
5. Quarantine - does the user quarantine a device if it is compromised, something else? Is this for alpha or post alpha?

Notes
IoT Device requirements 
Have - Piper (home automation system), LG Washing machine, Microft Intelligent speaker, Chromecast, Nintendo switch, smart light, Google Home, Alexa, stove, light, laptops, mobile phone, apple tv, NEST thermostat, power bar, 
Need - Ring Alarm, Smart tag for car, motion detetor sensor, camera, plugs, 
Analysis - builds a list of ip addresses. The user sees nothing. 
Filtering - build a whitelist and apply this to the device. Different level of access/symbol. Alpha users need to report if the device is working differently after filtering. This indicates that filetering is not working properly
Quarantine is not Alpha
Marc - will look into this
