# Secure Home Gateway & Registry Idea

For many internet organizations, the #1 risk in their risk register is a large scale (Dyn like) DDoS attack originating from IoT devices.  One of the mitigation mechanisms for this risk is to prevent weaponization of IoT devices.  IoT devices are weaponized when vulnerabilities are exposed or accessible to bad actors on the internet.  Protecting IoT devices at the edge with security access controls is another layer of security (because you canâ€™t have too may layers of security). The security access controls would be aimed at protecting the IoT devices from the internet, and to protect the internet from IoT devices.  

Nobody should think of connecting a 'dumb' IoT device directly on the internet, and with IPv6, this is just going to get worse, so now is the time to fix this.

This project is to develop a proof of concept and the document the requirement for a next generation secure home gateway and a home registry solution that with security controls can protect IoT devices and the internet from each other.  The project is an innovative IoT initiative to develop a solution for a secure home networks and a trust framework for its connected devices based on domain names and DNSSEC.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop open standards with IETF & ISO/IEC and to develop open source openWRT code that can be freely used to next generation secure home gateways.  The story in the slide deck is tuned to CIRA and .CA, but is mean to be adapted by all ccTLD on the planet.
