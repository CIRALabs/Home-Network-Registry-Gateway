# Secure Home Gateway & Registry Idea

For many internet organizations, the #1 risk on their risk register is a large scale (Dyn like) DDoS attack.   One of the mitigation mechanisms for this risk is to prevent weaponization of IoT devices.  IoT devices are weaponized when vulnerabilities are exposed to bad actors on the interent.  Protecting IoT devices at the edge is another layer of security (because you canâ€™t have too may layers of security). The security controls would be aimed at protecting the IoT devices from the internet, and to protect the internet from IoT devices.  

Nobody should think of connecting an IoT device directly on the internet, and with IPv6, this is just going to get worse, so now is the time to fix this.

This project is to develop a home gateway and a home registry solution that with security controls can protect IoT devcies and the internet.  The project is an innovative IoT initiative to develop a solution for a secure home networks and a trust framework for its connected devices based on domain names and DNSSEC.
